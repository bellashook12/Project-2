    nonsense = "In the heart of a bustling metropolis where skyscrapers towered like giants, there lived a peculiar little character named Hax. With a mischievous glint in his eyes and a knack for all things tech, Hax was unlike any other denizen of the city. Born in the depths of cyberspace, Hax emerged as a digital anomaly, a pixelated sprite with a penchant for adventure. Sporting a red hoodie with the hood perpetually drawn up and adorned with blue-lensed goggles that reflected the glow of computer screens, Hax was always ready to dive headfirst into the digital realm. But what truly set Hax apart was his trusty square backpack, a marvel of engineering with a lightbulb protruding from its depths. This backpack was no ordinary carryall; it was a repository of Hax's boundless creativity and ingenuity, a treasure trove of gadgets and gizmos waiting to be unleashed.  Hax's creator instilled in him a love for code and a desire to explore the limitless possibilities of the digital world. So, armed with his trusty backpack and fueled by his insatiable curiosity, Hax embarked on countless adventures, weaving his way through the tangled web of cyberspace and leaving a trail of code in his wake.

    question="Which of the following ideas would you associate with this picture?"
    answerSet = "dogPic"
    nonsense = "The golden sands stretch endlessly along the shore, kissed by the gentle lapping of azure waves. Against this picturesque backdrop, a golden retriever frolics with boundless joy, embodying the epitome of canine exuberance. With each bounding leap, sandy paws leave imprints like fleeting memories in the soft terrain, a testament to the dog's spirited exploration. Bathed in the warm glow of the sun, the golden retriever's fur gleams like spun gold, catching the light in a mesmerizing dance. Each strand seems to possess a life of its own, swaying with the rhythm of the ocean breeze. Yet, amidst this radiant spectacle, the true brilliance lies in the dog's eyes â€“ pools of liquid amber reflecting the wonder of the world around it. The dog's nose twitches, catching the scent of salt and seaweed carried on the wind. With an eager bark, it charges towards the water's edge, a fearless explorer ready to embrace the unknown. The surf rushes forward, greeting the retriever with playful splashes, inviting it into the embrace of the sea."
